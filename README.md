I had no previous experience, but was always interested in coding from my childhood, I finally got an opportunity to fulfulill my dreams by graduating  from Codaisseur Academy.:mortar_board:
I learned programming from scratch in 6 months and developed many full-blown apps and a number of smaller apps with JavaScript frameworks.:smile:

Also got an opportunity to work on real world project - [**The Idealists**](https://github.com/dashakrolik/Idealists-client)
